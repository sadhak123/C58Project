        <p id="readp">I like to read books whenever im feeling bored. My favorite subject is Geography and General Knowledge because i like to read about new things and intresting facts. I also love to solve Math problems because sovling maths problems are fun as games. One of the basic reasons why reading is important is that it helps us grow mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. Every book provides us an opportunity to learn and explore new ideas. Reading books increases our knowledge and makes us smarter.</p>
